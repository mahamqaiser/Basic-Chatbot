# Basic Chatbot 

A **basic rule-based chatbot** built in Python.  
It responds to a few predefined messages and ends the conversation when the user types `"bye"`.


##  Features
- Responds to:
  - `"hello"` → `"Hi!"`
  - `"how are you"` → `"I'm fine, thanks!"
  - `"what's your name"` → `"I'm a simple chatbot."`

- Gives a default response if the input is not recognized.


##  How to Run
1. **Install Python 3** (if not already installed).
2. Save the code in a file named `chatbot.py`.
3. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
